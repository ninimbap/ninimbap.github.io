  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12" id="container"><p>Thank you love. For being with me for the last couple of months and almost a year. Imagine babe almost a year?! I couldn't really imagine how fast things happen. And I'm really so grateful and thankful that you came into my life. Thank you for bearing with all my imperfections. I don't know how you do it, but I admire your love and patience towards this relationship. Thank you babe for always being there for me. For calming the shit storm in me. Trust me, I'll always be here for you. I might be hating you a hundred times but I'll never let go of you or leave you, my forever.</p>
